> **Calculus made easy**

The Calc-ULTRA calculus calculator, but as a module!

- Little Python background knowledge needed!

Supports:

- Derivatives
- Partials
- Implicit differentiation
- Antiderivatives
- Definite integrals
- Improper integrals

## Note

This is the module package of the Calc-ULTRA calculator. For the Python script of this package, visit <https://github.com/sudoer-Huatao/Calc-ULTRA> (unmaintained).

## Installation and Running

> Run the calculus calculator with a single line of code

Command line: `pip3 install calc-ultra`.
Due to Python import identifiers restrictions, please import Calc-ULTRA as "calc_ultra" and not "calc-ultra" when you need to use the calculator.

To run the calculator, import Calc-ULTRA as `calc_ultra` like so:

`from calc_ultra import main`

Make sure you have the latest version installed. To update calc-ultra, run `pip3 install --upgrade calc-ultra`.

## Requirements

This program requires the `sympy`,  `numpy`, `rich`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy` modules installed. Other required modules are built in to most Python IDEs.

## Warnings

### Function limitations

Due to limitations of the SymPy module, **some functions cannot be integrated**. The Error Function `erf(x)` can be integrated in both indefinite integral and definite integral calculation, but the Absolute Value and Factorial functions are only available to definite integral calculations. Integration of composed functions are also limited due to SymPy limitations. While some composed functions work, others don't. üòü
