Calc-ULTRA, but a module!

- No Python background knowledge needed.
- Supports derivatives, antiderivatives, and definite integrals - with a graph!
- (Please FULL SCREEN your console/terminal for better experience!)

## How to run

To run it, simply use pip to install. Then, import main from the calc_ultra module. That should run the calculator. Demo:

## Requirements

This program requires `sympy`,  `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `datetime`, `math`, `logging`, `warnings` and `os` modules. `datetime`, `math`, `logging`, `warnings` and `os` are built-in to most Python editors. The rest can be installed with the command `pip install MODULE_NAME`, though the required modules should be automatically downloaded.

# Warnings!!!

## Function limitations:

Due to limitations of the SymPy module, SOME FUNCTIONS CAN NOT BE INTEGRATED. The Error Function erf(x) can be integrated in both indefinite integral and definite integral calculation, but the Absolute Value and Factorial functions are only available to definite integral calculations. Also, the factorial function cannot be graphed properly. Integration of composed functions are also limited due to SymPy limitations. While some composed functions work, others don't. üòü
