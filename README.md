Calc-Ultra (styled as CALC ULTRA) is a multi-functional calculator that uses a command-line/menu-based interface. Little Python background knowledge is needed to use this calculator! (Please star the GitHub repo if you find this project helpful! ‚ù§Ô∏è)

Supports:

- Simple calculations (complex numbers supported!)
- Derivatives
- Partials
- Implicit differentiation
- Extrema Calculator
- Limits
- Antiderivatives
- Definite integrals
- Improper integrals
- Double integrals
- Solving (sets) of equation(s)
- Vector/matrix operations
- Taylor Polynomial Approximations
- **A perfect interface to do calculations!**

## Installation and Running

> Run the calculus calculator with a single line of code

Use the following command to install Calc-Ultra:

`pip3 install calc-ultra`

or

`python3 -m pip install calc-ultra` if you have lower versions of pip.

Due to Python import identifiers restrictions, please import Calc-Ultra as "calc_ultra" and not "calc-ultra".

Import Calc-Ultra like so to use:

`from calc_ultra import main`

Please make sure you have the latest version installed. To update calc-ultra, run the following command:

`pip3 install --upgrade calc-ultra`

## Requirements

Calc-Ultra requires these modules/packages to be installed:

- `sympy`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `rich`
- `prompt-toolkit`

If you do not have them installed, no need to worry! These modules should be installed automatically if you don't have them.
